## Assignments

Project 1 의 audio recordings (available at LMS) 의 training data 와 validation data 에서 한 명씩 선정하여 DTW 구현해 본다.
(너무 많은 data 를 쓰면 시간이 너무 오래 걸림)

1. Uniform filter bank energies
2. Mel-scale filter bank energies
3. MFCC

## NEXT Next topics (subject to change)

1. hidden Markov model (HMM) 
2. recurrent neural network (RNN)
