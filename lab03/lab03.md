# Lab 03 FIR filter design
- attached: [`lab03_filtering.ipynb`](lab03_filtering.ipynb)

## Programming assignments: Short Time Fourier transform with filtering

- Write `getFIRFFT` function from scratch without referencing the implementation shown above. 보지 않고 작성해 본다.
- Overlap add: 10ms shift, 3ms overlap, trapezoidal window
    - use time-varying bandpass filter with center frequencies grows along time
